          In this blog post we explain why creation of the omnibus account by the Bank of England is an important step and how it is relevant to a wide array of use-cases.
On 19/04/2021 the Bank of England released a statement on Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Announcing the creation of CBDC engagement and technology forums the statement received a great deal of attention.
However, attached to the same email newsletter was a smaller piece of policy news titled - “Bank of England publishes policy for omnibus accounts in RTGS” 1.

          In this post we look at the consequences of the Archegos saga and ask ourselves:
 What happened? Why did it happen? What do we want to do about it?  What happened?
On Friday (26/03/2021) murmurs that a large fund was going pop started to surface. As many people have already discussed, Archegos Capital Management received a margin call which it could not fund and its prime brokers started to unwind its positions.

          In 2009 at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh the largest global economies took a long hard look at themselves and asked the question - ‘how do we stop that happening again?’.
Of course, they were talking about the global financial crash and the failure of Lehman Brothers.
Whilst the analysis of what caused the crisis remains debated to this day, what was clear at the time is that OTC derivatives trading practises certainly didn’t help.

          In this short post we explain how blockchain technology can be used for more than simple value transfer between two counterparties. Indeed, we discuss how blockchain, and DLT, enables not just removal of the intermediaries in payments but also the third-parties responsible for calculations throughout the entire trade life-cycle.
Where are we?
The introduction of intermediaries to maintain ledgers of deposits was a key development in the history of money. The ability for merchants to deposit in one city and withdraw in another enabled movement of capital on a larger scale than before and was responsible for a significant rise in global economic development.
