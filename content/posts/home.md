As more financial use-cases are deployed on public blockchain networks common standards and frameworks will be required.

**Margined Protocol** is a set of generalised protocols for building and deploying margin engines, and more, on public blockchain networks.

The project aims to enable the deployment of _traditional financial_ use-cases onto public blockchain networks, whilst also providing a smart contract and tooling library that can be used in _decentralised finance_ applications.

In addition to providing generalised smart contracts for applications including:

* _virtual_ Automated Market Makers
* Margin and Valuation Engines
* _Smart_ Financial Collateral Arrangements

**Margined Protocol** will also provide off-chain tools and services for:

* Automation of Post-Trade Operations
* Tokenisation of Traditional Financial Assets
* On- and Off-Chain Risk Management
