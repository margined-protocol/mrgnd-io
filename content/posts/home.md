**Margined Protocol** is a set of generalised protocols for building margin engines and more on public blockchain networks.

As more financial use-cases are deployed on public blockchain networks common standards and frameworks will be required. Not just for tokenisation of assets but also:

* Valuation and Margin Methodologies
* Risk Management
* Clearing and Settlement

**Margined Protocol**'s frameworks will enable traditional financial players to interact with and adopt public blockchain applications such as AMMs, perpetuals and others. Whilst also enabling those counterparties to create bespoke bilateral trade arrangements and use on-chain risk management tools and analytics.

## Why is this important?

Increasing the adoption of public blockchain networks is critical for their long-term success as the existing settlement systems are creaking and highly centralised. Bringing traditional financial players to public networks will help create a more robust financial system whilst disrupting the power asymmetries that plague the current state.

## Roadmap

* v1 General Margin Engine Terra Blockchain
    * Provides users the ability to create perpetual contracts on the Terra blockchain
